## ✅ Requirement(s)
Node.js version 20 or higher. To check your current version: 
```
node --version
```

## 🔧 Installation 
You can add Cognitive3D to your javascript project in two ways. 
### Option 1. Install from NPM
Inside your javascript project's terminal, run the following command 
```
npm install @cognitive3d/analytics
```
### Option 2. Install from source code
If you want the entire source code, whether that be to run tests, make modifications, you can clone this repository by
#### A) Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CognitiveVR/c3d-sdk-webxr.git
cd c3d-sdk-webxr
```
#### B) Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
#### C) Build the sdk
This will transpile the SDK src files into a `/lib` folder
```bash
npm run build
```
#### D) Install the local sdk to your project 
Navigate to your projects directory, and then run the following command
```bash
npm install /pathTo/c3d-sdk-webxr
```
## 📂 Project Structure 
Here's an overview of the key files and directories in the project:
```text
c3d-sdk-webxr/
├── src/                 # Contains the source code for the SDK.
   ├── adapters/         # Modules for integrating with Three.js, Babylon.js, PlayCanvas, etc.
   └── utils/            # Utility modules for framerate tracking, HMD orientation, etc.
├── __tests__/           # Contains all the Jest tests for the SDK.
├── assets/              # Contains images and logos used in the readme.
├── lib/                 # Generated by the build process, contains the transpiled SDK files (UMD, ESM, CJS).
└── settings.js          # Configuration file for the SDK tests (API key, scene info).
```

## 🚀 Usage

The SDK is designed to be flexible and can be integrated into various JavaScript projects. The build process creates multiple module formats in the `/lib` folder to support different environments.
- index.umd.js (Universal Module Definition): One-size-fits-all for direct use in browsers. It's designed to be dropped into a <script> tag on a webpage. 
- index.esm.js (ES Module): The modern module standard for JavaScript. It's used by default in most web bundlers and modern Node.js.
- index.cjs.js (CommonJS): The module format for older Node.js environments.
